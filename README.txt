Here, we provide the datasets used in the paper and the scripts to implement the core score inference algorithms proposed in the paper. The 'Datasets' folder contains the real-world and syntheic datasets we validate the proposed core scores inference algorithms on. The code snippets to load the datasets are provided within the inference algorithm scripts. The file 'Synthetic_Data.ipynb' contains the code to generate data synthetically using the proposed models, namely, GA-Affine-Real, GA-Affine-Bool, GA-Nonlinear, and AO.
The scripts 'GA-Affine-Real.ipynb','GA-Affine-Bool.ipynb','GA-Nonlinear.ipynb', and 'AO.ipynb' contain implementations of the proposed inference algorithms related to the GA-Affine-Real, GA-Affine-Bool, GA-Nonlinear, and AO models, respectively.
